# disk

## boot partition:

```
    This is the root dir for the boot partition.
    It uses the FAT16 files system. This is why we have 8.3 DOS style here.
```

## main folders:

```
    EFI/
    GRAMADO/
    PROGRAMS/
    USERS/
```

## system partition:

```
    We will create the system partition, it will be formated 
    in the ext2 file system format and it will use lowercase names.
```

## Quote

```
 * All these pieces, broken and scattered
 * In mercy gathered, mended and whole
 * Empty handed but not forsaken
 * I've been set free, I've been set free.
